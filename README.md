# Twitter-analysis
#For this project our group analysed the behavior of danish politicians on Twitter. 

#For this purpose we did the following:
# (1) created a network-model in order to investigate inter- and intra party engagements on Twitter. We find evidence that Twitter serve as an echo-champer as politicians mainly engage with politicans from their own or similar parties.
# (2) create a bi-gram of word to determine which subject were discussed in the given time-frame of the analysis.
# (3) carried out a sentiment analysis to determine how the respective parties communicate on Twitter.
# (4) crated a machine learning model predicting the number of likes a Tweet will get.

# All code is in the "Master_0" file.
# The written analysis is in the PDF.
