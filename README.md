# Twitter-analysis
For this project our group analysed the behavior of danish politicians on Twitter. 

For this purpose we did the following:

  (1) created a network-model in order to investigate inter- and intra party engagements on Twitter. We find evidence that Twitter serve as an echo-champer as    politicians mainly engage with politicans from their own or similar parties.
  (2) create a bi-gram of word to determine which subject were discussed in the given time-frame of the analysis.
  (3) carried out a sentiment analysis to determine how the respective parties communicate on Twitter.
  (4) crated a machine learning model predicting the number of likes a Tweet will get.

All code is in the "Master_0" file.
The written analysis is in the PDF.
